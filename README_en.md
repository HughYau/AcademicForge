## 📖 What is a Forge?

The name "Forge" is inspired by **Minecraft's mod loader system** (like Forge or Fabric), which allows players to run multiple mods together seamlessly. Just as Minecraft Forge provides a modpack that integrates various mods for specific gameplay experiences, **Academic Forge** integrates multiple Claude Code skills for a focused academic writing workflow.

### Why "Forge"?

- 🔧 **Integration over Installation** - Just like Minecraft modpacks, you get a curated collection that works well together
- 🎯 **Purpose-Built** - Each forge targets a specific domain (academic writing, web development, data science, etc.)
- 🔄 **Automatic Updates** - Skills stay current via git submodules plus skills-only sync sources
- 🤝 **Community-Driven** - Built on the excellent work of multiple skill creators

## 🎯 Purpose

Academic Forge solves a common problem: **too many skills lead to poor AI agent accuracy**. By curating only the skills relevant to academic writing and research, Claude Code can:

- ✅ Make more precise skill invocations
- ✅ Avoid confusion between similar skills
- ✅ Maintain focus on your research workflow
- ✅ Stay up-to-date with improvements from original authors

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

Install Academic Forge directly into your Claude Code project:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd your-project

# Install the forge
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HughYau/AcademicForge/refs/heads/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:

```bash
# Clone repository (with submodules; skills-only sources are synced by scripts)
git clone --recursive https://github.com/HughYau/AcademicForge .opencode/skills/academic-forge

# Or if you already cloned without --recursive
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Download/Sync Skills

If you want to sync skills in an existing clone (submodules + skills-only sources):

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\scripts\download-skills.ps1
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
bash scripts/download-skills.sh
```

These scripts automatically sync your local `skills/` folder, including submodules, the `superpowers` `skills/` snapshot, and the `planning-with-files` `.opencode/skills/planning-with-files` snapshot. For detailed usage instructions, see [scripts/SKILLS-DOWNLOAD-README.md](./scripts/SKILLS-DOWNLOAD-README.md).

### Update Skills

Keep all skills up-to-date with the latest improvements:

```bash
cd .opencode/skills/academic-forge
./scripts/update.sh
```

> Optional: To block specific upstream skills, edit `scripts/skill-blacklist.txt`. Install/download/update scripts automatically remove listed paths.

#### 🔄 Automatic Updates

This repository is configured with automated workflows that update all skill sources (submodules + superpowers/planning-with-files skills-only sync) **every Monday at 09:00 UTC**. This means:

- ✅ Skills always stay up-to-date
- ✅ Automatically receive improvements and bug fixes from original authors
- ✅ No need to manually run update scripts
- 📅 Update schedule: Every Monday at 09:00 UTC

Academic Forge uses a hybrid version model (git submodules + skills-only sync for selected sources):

- **Automatic Updates**: Run `./scripts/update.sh` to pull latest changes
- **Version Locking**: Commit the `.gitmodules` state and tracked `skills/superpowers` + `skills/planning-with-files` changes
- **Rollback Safety**: Use git to revert to previous working states
