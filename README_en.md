## 📖 What is a Forge?

The name "Forge" is inspired by **Minecraft's mod loader system** (like Forge or Fabric), which allows players to run multiple mods together seamlessly. Just as Minecraft Forge provides a modpack that integrates various mods for specific gameplay experiences, **Academic Forge** integrates multiple Claude Code skills for a focused academic writing workflow.

### Why "Forge"?

- 🔧 **Integration over Installation** - Just like Minecraft modpacks, you get a curated collection that works well together
- 🎯 **Purpose-Built** - Each forge targets a specific domain (academic writing, web development, data science, etc.)
- 🔄 **Automatic Updates** - Skills remain linked to their original repositories via git submodules
- 🤝 **Community-Driven** - Built on the excellent work of multiple skill creators

## 🎯 Purpose

Academic Forge solves a common problem: **too many skills lead to poor AI agent accuracy**. By curating only the skills relevant to academic writing and research, Claude Code can:

- ✅ Make more precise skill invocations
- ✅ Avoid confusion between similar skills
- ✅ Maintain focus on your research workflow
- ✅ Stay up-to-date with improvements from original authors
