notes: |
  Academic Forge uses git submodules to integrate skills from their original
  repositories where possible. superpowers is intentionally distributed as a
  skills-only snapshot (skills/superpowers), synced from
  https://github.com/obra/superpowers/tree/main/skills.

  All skills retain their original licenses and authorship.
  
  This forge is inspired by Minecraft's mod loader concept, providing a curated
  collection of skills that work well together for academic writing workflows.
